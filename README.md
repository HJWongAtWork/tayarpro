# TayarPro - A Vuetify Project

This is the README file for TayarPro, a learning project built with Vuetify.js.

This project was lovingly built by Group 4 of the Gamuda AI Academy, Malaysia for educational purposes only. Everything done here - good or bad practices - has been from the process of learning.

Hope any viewers will learn from our coded experiences too!!! As per disclaimer, none of this is intended for any form of commercial use, although if you want to use the framework, by all means (just get proper permission from the appropriate sources before commercialising).

To be used with Google's Cloud services, or with another repositories' back end [here](https://github.com/HJWongAtWork/tayarpro-be).

## Installation

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    - If you have the TayarPro repository URL, clone it using `git clone <repository_url>`.
    - If the project is local, navigate to the project directory using `cd TayarPro`.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Open your terminal and run the following command to install all the project dependencies:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

## Development Mode

1. **Start the development server:**
    - After installing dependencies, run the following command to start the development server:

      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

    - This will start a development server typically at `http://localhost:3000` (the port may vary). 

2. **Development:**
    - Open the link in your browser to see the application running in development mode.
    - Any changes you make to the code will be reflected automatically in the browser, allowing for a smooth development experience.
